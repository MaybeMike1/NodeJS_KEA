    <h3>First Year Project</h3>
    <p>The first year project was a project, that I work on with 3 of my fellow students. Our teacher assigned a some requirements for the system.
        We had to work with Java Spring Boot MVC and JDBC template, so our system was able to fetch data from the database and show it in the application.
        In order to do this, we had to write SQL statements in our Java program, so when some data was submitted through the application. It would be stored in the
        database as well. So all data was saved and stored. We worked with fetch, delete, update and create also known as CRUD.
