    <h1 class="h1">Node Package Manager - How to use it</h1>
    <article class="textField">
        <p>
            Node Package Manager is what we use to install new packages to support or be used in our applications. It is therefore pretty essential
            to understand. We use npm to install dependencies into our package.json file. For instance, if you want to install nodemon to your project, you would use
            "npm install nodemon". There will be an update in the package.json file with the new dependency added as a key:value pair.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are different flags, that can be used with npm. I will try to explain the essential once, that I have been using during this NodeJS course so far.
            <li>
                Global - when you want to install a dependencies globally. You want to add in a "-g" after npm command to specify that this dependency should be avaliable
                in any project on my local machine. The syntax looks as following: "npm install -g nodemon", the -g again specifies that the package manager should install this package
                globally.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Install - there is a shorthand for the install command for npm, that can save you a bit of time in rush hours. It is completely alright to use "install"..
                But what if I told you, that you could discard all the letters in install and add a dash in front. That would work as good as install. The syntax for this is as followed:
                "npm -i express". In this command I take -i instead of install to add express to my package.json.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                devDependecy- This is another type of dependency, devDep is used to for developer purposes. You could use this to install test-enviroment or use to implement something to see
                if it fits the project. Even though as I mentioned early the devDep is not the same as the dependencies in package.json. This is added in the developerDependency key in the json file.
                It can still be used the package, that has been installed. But it won't be used in production. The syntax for this is as followed: "npm install --save-dev".
            </li>
